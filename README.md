## Sparsile Museums

Or, an API to ping an art museum's open API to return an image based on a color calculated using basic sentiment anaylsis of user-provided text. Currently supporting the Cooper Hewitt API and planned support for the Rijksmuseum API.

You are responsible for abiding by the supported museums' terms and conditions and will need to request API keys from each museum. See the **How to Use** section for configuration.

Everything's fine but it is not in a usable state these days. Come back later m(._.)m.
